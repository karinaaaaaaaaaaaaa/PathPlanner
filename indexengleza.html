    <p class="text "> I've noticed that lately, people, but especially students, don't have time for themselves, and this can affect their mental health. With our app, we want to help them in this direction. More specifically, PathPlanner organizes their time so that they finish all their tasks, both school and personal, but also have time to socialize and have fun. Thus, they will have a perfect day. </p>
